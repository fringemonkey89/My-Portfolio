# Hello There!
My name is Marko Majetic, I am a budding web developer and this repository contains my portfolio website.
This webpage contains a header with links to different sections on the webpage with an About Me section
that gives a concise summary of who I am and what my coding capabilities can achieve.
There is a work section that holds all of the projects I've completed and if you click on them
they will deploy the application. My portfolio website also features a myriad of links to contact me in the 
footer section.
